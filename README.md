# MyLearningOfHaskell

A compilation of notes, source code and exercices made during... my learning of haskell

Starting point is :
- [learn you a haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
- [french version](http://lyah.haskell.fr/)

## Starting with IO

after a few attempts to make it work on a bigger project, back to basics...

## The Game of Matches

a simple Mim Game, where starting with 4 rows of [1,3,5,7] matches, 2 player draw on each turn between 1 and 3 matches on a single line. Player that draw the last loses.

Implementing includes a min max, and some interesting functions, as well as some IO for the actual game.

See [Allumettes](Allumettes/README.md)
